# SALSA Basic 3D Demo

SALSA (Simple Automated LipSync Aproximation) is a realtime system for creating lip synchronization from audio input without the need for phoneme mapping or baking. This creates a simple and fast workflow that allows the designer to implement lipsync into their project without spending a lot of time or effort.
